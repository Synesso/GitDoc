# Engineering Design Document

This document is place to collect all of the things that need to be done to implement the git document review feature described in the prd.md file.

This file WILL NOT be created in one go. It MUST be incrementally updated as you investigate and learn more about the project. Most of the time you will be adding 'Things to Explore' bullet points to the document as you learn discover more things that you need to better understand before you can start have a comprehensive but concise design.

It is extremely important that you first generate ideas for what you need to explore to see if it is relevant to the project. Sometimes you will have questions that later turn out to be irrelevant to the project and that is ok, just explore, learn and update the document as you go along with progress.md.

# Things to Explore
- [ ] What should be the architecture of the service?
- [ ] Where will it be deployed? Something internal to Block?
- [ ] How will comments be attributable to the github user?
- [ ] Be sure to align the comments 1:1 with line comments in the underlying PRs
